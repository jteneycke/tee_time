#Scenario
Your team is working with a golf club management company. As part of an enterprise-wide update the company would like a Rails app for booking tee times at their various clubs. Your job is to prototype the application for the booking interface.

#Your Deliverable
This is not a design assignment. While the app should be usable, it needn't look pretty. If you wish to use something like Twitter Bootstrap that's perfectly acceptable.

This exercise is not designed to take a long time. How much time you spend is totally up to you, but do not feel obligated to spend more than a few hours.

Please submit the project as a git repo if possible.

#Iteration 1
Build a prototype Rails app which allows a user to book a tee-time at a single golf club.

#Acceptance criteria:
- [x] Tee times are separated by 20 minutes.
- [x] Only one user may book a given twenty-minute slot.
- [x] The golf club is open for bookings from 9am to 5pm every day.
- [x] Users should have some mechanism to see if a time is already booked.
- [x] Users should be able to cancel a booking.
